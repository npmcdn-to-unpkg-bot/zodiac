**Reactive Rendering Library**

---

Zodiac is a reactive rendering library. It solves some of the same problems as tools like React, Elm and CycleJS. It is very modular and minimal, while still being powerful, efficient and fun to use.

TODO: Right now it is still in development.

The actual README is here:
