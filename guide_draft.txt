2. Basics
  2.1 Preface
  2.2 The guide
  2.3 The problem
    (model -> view, state vs presentation, front vs back,
    existing solutions, strengths, problems)
  2.4 Principles
  2.5 A simple app
    (properties, live values, event listeners, reactivity, class and id,
    syntax sugar; arrays, ifs and loops)
  2.6 Components
    (generalizing/abstracting shared logic)
  2.7 Concerning architecture
    (complex state, nested state, shared state,
    responsibilities: who writes,
    separating logic, presentation and the data layer)
