I have to be able to do `inline code`. As well as this:

    Preformatted blocks

And sometimes you have to <kbd>Alt-F4</kbd>

Most start their front end styles by throwing in a reset such as Eric Myer's or the more fashionable <mark>normalize.css</mark>. I will say a few nasty things about both approaches before I present to you the perfectionist alternative: *Your own custom foundation*.

**Foundation** is a good word for a different approach. Resets strip user agent default styles back. Normalizing attempts to even out the differences and fix a few things. A foundation strips and adds styles where it makes sense to minimize the amount of declarations and overrides you will have to make later. While a foundation can be replicated elsewhere, it is simple and intended to be built on top of.

1. Gadget reticulators
  1. Once
  2. Twice
  3. Forevermore
2. Foobar influx capacitors
3. Spline vertex normalization

And here goes..

A horizotal line and an unordered list.

And maybe definition lists...

<dl>
<dt>Definition list</dt>
<dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

<dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
<dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

Well, it works in modern versions, so there!
