Todo:

- markup for id as well as class
- cleanup template logic
- Extract lib funcs like _is and _castArray
- Modularize template lib so bits can be tested
- Template unit tests
- Integrate reactive router
- Have reactive router support sub-paths
- Homepage app with documentation and live examples
- src/toolbox.js - with some useful default components

Lower priority
- animator components implemented on top of existing ones

Maybe:
- Allow reactive variables directly to infer .get?
- More efficient loops by enabling reactive getter?
