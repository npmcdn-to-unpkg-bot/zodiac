Todo:
- Rework examples to index.js -> App.js
- Share example logic between playground and template integration tests
- Modularize template lib so bits can be tested
- Template unit tests
- Integrate reactive router
- Have reactive router support sub-paths
- Homepage app with documentation and live examples

Maybe:
- Allow reactive variables directly to infer .get?
- More efficient loops by enabling reactive getter?
