Todo:

- Fix dynamic nodes
- Share example logic between playground and template integration tests
- Modularize template lib so bits can be tested
- Template unit tests
- Integrate reactive router
- Have reactive router support sub-paths
- Homepage app with documentation and live examples

Lower priority
- animator components implemented on top of existing ones

Maybe:
- Allow reactive variables directly to infer .get?
- More efficient loops by enabling reactive getter?
