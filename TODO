Guide:
  - visual style
  - topbar with links, icons, search, toc

Zodiac:
  - markup for id as well as class
  - Port reactive router
  - Have reactive router support sub-paths

Maybe:
- Allow reactive variables directly to infer .get?
- More efficient loops by enabling reactive getter?

Housekeeping
  - only require tracker when it is not defined
  - require -> import
  - coffeescript vs babel
  - cleaner template logic
  - extract funcs like _is and _castArray
  - Modularize for testability?
  - Unit tests
  - bundle some useful default components (architecture and ui)

Low priority
  - animator components implemented on top of existing ones?
